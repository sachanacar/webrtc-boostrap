You would think WebRTC is perfect for Javascript developers, it’s actually hard. Web developers getting into WebRTC need to understand concepts that are often out of their grasp: Codecs, gateways, signaling frameworks, STUN/TURN/ICE servers, mobile SDKs, and much more. Though many vendors have their own quick-start guides, there is no place that can guide new developers to scale their WebRTC platform, vendor-agnostic. Developers are lazy, and the current state of WebRTC is not lazy-friendly. This is probably why WebRTC is not as popular as other Web APIs, though it’s one of the most powerful!

Many expert WebRTC developers wished they had had more resources when needing to scale their projects.

Here comes WebRTC Bootstrap!

I figured the hard part for developers is actually getting started so I wanted to launch a crowdsourced starter-kit and "WebRTC dictionary". It’s a reading-friendly WebRTC starter kit for developers by developers. It includes a list of vendors/SDKs for all the necessary steps and a WebRTC dictionary with all the terms needed to get familiar with WebRTC development and help you bootstrap your way through deploying your WebRTC solution.
