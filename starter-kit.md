This kit is aimed at helping developer find resources that belong to each of the stages needed to successfully deploy a WebRTC solution. You’ll find links and descriptions of frameworks and vendors that provide solutions to help you do so.

Best thing is, it’s all open source!


##Client Side

###Signalling Frameworks

A signalling framework helps your application understand the basics of a voice communication (ring, call, hang up, etc.). More info about signalling [here](/webrtc-dictionnary/#signalling).

1. SIP
    *   [JSSIP](http://jssip.net/): Opensource JS library for SIP-over-websockets signalling. Maintained by Versatica.
    *   [SIP.js](http://sipjs.com/): Opensource JS library for SIP-over-websockets signalling. Maintained by OnSIP.
    *   [SIPML5](http://sipml5.org/): Opensource Javascript SIP/SDP stack. Maintained by Doubango Telecom.

2. XMPP

3. JSON

###Mobile SDKs

##Server Side

###TURN/STUN Servers

TURN and STUN servers enable the communication to go through even if the user is behind a NAT. More info [here](/webrtc-dictionnary/#NAT).
